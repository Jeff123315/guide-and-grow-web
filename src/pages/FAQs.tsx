        {
          question: "How do I book my first appointment?",
          answer: "You can book your first appointment by clicking the 'Book Free Consultation' button on our website, calling us directly, or using our contact form. We offer a free 15-minute consultation to discuss your needs and answer any questions before your first session."
        },
        {
          question: "What should I expect in my first session?",
          answer: "Your first session is about getting to know you and understanding your concerns. We'll discuss your goals, background, and what brings you to therapy. This is also a time for you to ask questions and decide if we're a good fit. There's no pressureâ€”it's a collaborative conversation."
        },
        {
          question: "Do you offer virtual/online sessions?",
          answer: "Yes! We offer both in-person and secure teletherapy sessions via video conferencing. Many clients prefer the convenience and comfort of online sessions, especially for ongoing therapy."
        },
        {
          question: "How long does each session last?",
          answer: "Standard individual therapy sessions are 50-60 minutes. Couples and family sessions may be longer (75-90 minutes). We'll discuss the best session length for your specific needs during your consultation."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      category: "Cost & Insurance",
      questions: [
        {
          question: "How much do sessions cost?",
          answer: "Our rates vary by service type and therapist. Individual therapy sessions typically range from $80-150 per session. We offer sliding scale fees based on income for those who qualify. Contact us for specific pricing information."
        },
        {
          question: "Do you accept insurance?",
          answer: "We are in-network with many major insurance providers. We can verify your benefits before your first appointment. If we're out-of-network with your insurance, we can provide a superbill for potential reimbursement."
        },
        {
          question: "What payment methods do you accept?",
          answer: "We accept cash, credit/debit cards, mobile payments, and electronic bank transfers. Payment is typically due at the time of service. We also offer payment plans for extended therapy packages."
        },
        {
          question: "Do you offer sliding scale or reduced fees?",
          answer: "Yes, we have a limited number of sliding scale spots available for individuals with financial constraints. Please discuss this during your initial consultation, and we'll work with you to find an affordable solution."
        }

    {
      category: "Therapy Process",
      questions: [
        {
          question: "How long will I need therapy?",
          answer: "The length of therapy varies greatly depending on your goals, concerns, and progress. Some clients benefit from short-term therapy (8-12 sessions), while others engage in longer-term work. We'll regularly review your progress and adjust the treatment plan together."
        },
        {
          question: "Is everything I share confidential?",
          answer: "Yes, confidentiality is a cornerstone of therapy. Everything you share is protected by law, with very few exceptions (such as risk of harm to yourself or others, child/elder abuse, or court orders). We'll review confidentiality limits during your first session."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I switch therapists if needed?",
          answer: "Absolutely. The therapeutic relationship is crucial to progress, and it's important you feel comfortable with your therapist. If you'd like to try working with a different member of our team, we'll facilitate that transition respectfully."
        },
        {
          question: "What if I need to cancel or reschedule?",
          answer: "We understand that life happens. We ask for at least 24 hours notice for cancellations or rescheduling. Late cancellations or no-shows may incur a fee. We'll discuss our full cancellation policy during your first session."

        },
        {
          question: "What is trauma-informed care?",
          answer: "Trauma-informed care recognizes the widespread impact of trauma and creates a safe, supportive environment for healing. Our therapists are trained in evidence-based trauma treatments including EMDR, CPT, and trauma-focused CBT."
        },

          question: "What should I do in a mental health emergency?",

          answer: "Yes, we provide crisis intervention and support. While we don't offer 24/7 emergency services, we can help with safety planning, immediate stabilization, and connecting you with appropriate emergency resources."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I contact my therapist between sessions?",
          answer: "Brief check-ins via email or phone are generally acceptable for scheduling or urgent concerns. However, therapy work happens during sessions. If you're experiencing a crisis, please contact crisis services rather than waiting for a callback."
